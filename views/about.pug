          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p I am a former Clinical Psychology researcher who studied depression and anxiety, and am now an aspiring Software Engineer. I found my passion for coding when I was working in research. I had a strong desire to find ways to make manual research processes more efficient. I taught myself Python on nights and weekends in order to learn how to automate these tasks, and in doing so, fell in love with coding. I am lucky to have the opportunity to be a part of  AnitaB.org and Intuit's Apprenticeship Pathway Program, and I am in the process of completing the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree as part of the program. I am a Full Stack Developer, and love working on both the frontend and backend.
